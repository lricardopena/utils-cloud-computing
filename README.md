This repo is a collection of useful classes for manage some repeated task among several cloud services.

This repo assumes that you have the credentials configured of the service to use in the machine, for example if you are going to use amazon is assumed that the credentials are in the system https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/setup-credentials.html, or in the case of GCP https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started 

If you think that we need to add some special function or change how we do the stuff you are free to do a PR.
